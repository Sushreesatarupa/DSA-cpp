Explanation of Double ended queue of STL in C++ through documentation.

Deque


A deque is a dynamic array whose size can be efficiently changed at both ends of
the array. Like a vector, a deque provides the functions push_back and pop_back,
but it also includes the functions push_front and pop_front which are not available in a vector.
A deque can be used as follows:

deque<int> d;

d.push_back(5); // [5]

d.push_back(2); // [5,2]

d.push_front(3); // [3,5,2]

d.pop_back(); // [3,5]

d.pop_front(); // [5]

The internal implementation of a deque is more complex than that of a vector,
and for this reason, a deque is slower than a vector. Still, both adding and
removing elements take O(1) time on average at both ends.
