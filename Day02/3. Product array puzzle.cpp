3. Product array puzzle 
Given an array nums[] of size n, construct a Product Array P (of same size n) such that P[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
nums[] = {10, 3, 5, 6, 2}
Output:
180 600 360 300 900
Explanation: 
For i=0, P[i] = 3*5*6*2 = 180.
For i=1, P[i] = 10*5*6*2 = 600.
For i=2, P[i] = 10*3*6*2 = 360.
For i=3, P[i] = 10*3*5*2 = 300.
For i=4, P[i] = 10*3*5*6 = 900.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 2
nums[] = {12,0}
Output:
0 12

Your Task:
You do not have to read input. Your task is to complete the function productExceptSelf() that takes array nums[] and n as input parameters and returns a list of n integers denoting the product array P. If the array has only one element the returned list should should contains one value i.e {1}
Note: Try to solve this problem without using the division operation.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)
 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= numsi <= 200
Array may contain duplicates.
