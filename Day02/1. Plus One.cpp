/**
1. Plus One 
Given a non-negative number represented as a list of digits, add 1 to the number (increment the number represented by the digits). The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is first element of array.
 

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {1, 2, 4}
Output: 
1 2 5
Explanation:
124+1 = 125, and so the Output
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {9,9,9}
Output: 
1 0 0 0
Explanation:
999+1 = 1000, and so the output

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. You only need to complete the function increment() that takes an integer N, and an array arr of size N as input and returns a list of integers denoting the new number which we get after adding one to the number denoted by the array arr.


Expected Time Complexity:  O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= arri <= 9
