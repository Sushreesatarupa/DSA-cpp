Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {2,4,1,3,5}
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
A[] = {10,2}
Output: -1
Your Task:
Complete the function thirdLargest() which takes the array a[] and the size of the array, n, as input parameters and returns the third largest element in the array. It return -1 if there are less than 3 elements in the given array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105
