/******
  Trailing zeroes in factorial 
  For an integer N find the number of trailing zeroes in N!.

  Example 1:

  Input:
  N = 5
  Output:
  1
  Explanation:
  5! = 120 so the number of trailing zero is 1.
  Example 2:

  Input:
  N = 4
  Output:
  0
  Explanation:
  4! = 24 so the number of trailing zero is 0.
  Your Task:  
  You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function trailingZeroes() which take an integer N as an input parameter and returns the count of trailing zeroes in the N!.

  Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)
  Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

  Constraints:
  1 <= N <= 109
